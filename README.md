# To-do app to get started with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Remember to run `yarn install` before `yarn start`.

This app is available at [To-do app react](https://polpo-todo-app.herokuapp.com/).

A proper description will be added later :)
